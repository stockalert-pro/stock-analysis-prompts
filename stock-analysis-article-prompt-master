### Example Opening (for reference):

"When Satya Nadella took the helm at Microsoft in 2014, the company was losing relevance-stuck in the PC era while mobile computing revolutionized the world. 'We need to rediscover our soul,' Nadella told employees on his first day. That soul, it turned out, was cloud computing. Fast forward to 2025, and Microsoft's Azure platform generates over $100 billion annually, while the company's AI partnership with OpenAI has positioned it at the forefront of the next computing revolution. For investors, Microsoft's transformation from Windows-dependent dinosaur to cloud-and-AI powerhouse represents one of the most successful corporate reinventions in history."
